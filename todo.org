#+TITLE: pstruct todos

* Support endianness configuration
** DONE both per-item and global; currently only per-item options
** TODO update runtime to use endianness properly

* Allow setting array max size // bounded unknown arrays
** define syntax; probably an option?

* Add enums

* #define support for constants or similar

* Template tests? Can I do that in a non-shit way?
** Some kind of full test where it runs through go test

* Make code a bit more language-agnostic

* Dummy values (not stored in struct)

* Magic values -> kinda like dummy values, but have a constraint associated

* Better error checking for cstrings

* Error message when defining reserved struct items
** Need to figure out what those are first
