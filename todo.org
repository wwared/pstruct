#+TITLE: pstruct todos

* Make arrays work
** Constant length
** Non-constant length support in arrays
** Store length in variable

* Move template code to its own module

* Make template code a bit more language-extendable
** If it looks too annoying to make it without having another language to write for, just ignore for now

* Make this write to files

* Run go fmt after creating file

* Add cli interface with clap

* Error message when defining reserved struct items
** Need to figure out what those are first

* Upper bound on unknown array sizes

* Support endianness configuration
** Maybe as a per-item basis with "tags"?

* Template tests? Can I do that in a non-shit way?
** At least tests for the filters/functions

* Some kind of full test where it runs through go test
