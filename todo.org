#+TITLE: pstruct todos

* Make arrays work
** DONE Constant length
** DONE Non-constant length support in arrays
** DONE Store length in variable
** Get rid of repetition

* Variable sized array must have count before the array
** Otherwise the encoding makes no sense

* Syntax for options; both local and global

* Allow setting array size type; has to be an int

* Allow setting array max size

* Make this write to files

* Run go fmt after creating file

* Add cli interface with clap

* Error message when defining reserved struct items
** Need to figure out what those are first

* Upper bound on unknown array sizes; aka prefix-length encoded fixed size array or something

* #define support for constants or similar

* Support endianness configuration
** Maybe as a per-item basis with "tags"?

* Template tests? Can I do that in a non-shit way?
** Some kind of full test where it runs through go test

* Make template code a bit more language-extendable
** If it looks too annoying to make it without having another language to write for, just ignore for now
